As a Product Manager, one frequent problem ir to focus too much on the current fires (daily tasks) and not dedicate enough efforts into the long term vision of a product. 

Both things are necessary for the success of the product and team, but usually the long term vision is the most relegated task and is a critical one to monitor regularly. 

Many PMs block time of their agendas to avoid falling in this common trap and to have a space to just focus on long term thinking.
