## **Lecture 1 - Introduction** 

### **a. What is an algorithm?**

A sequence of simple steps, that uses flow of control process to specify when each step is executed and, a means of determining when to stop.  

Algorithms are recipes / Recipes are algorithms 

A computer will only do what you tell it to do (using algorithms).

### **b. Aspects of Languages**

Anything computable in one language is computable in any other programming language.  

In programming languages the primitive constructs of the language are: numbers, strings and simple operators (at least for Python).  

The syntax of a language are the rules that are allow in the process of combining the primitive constructs. 

The semantics of a language is the meaning associated with a syntactically correct string of symbols with no static semantic errors. 

Natural languages can have many meanings associated to the same expression, because the brain can understand the phrase in context, and derive it's meaning from that context.

But in programming, each statement can have only one meaning, because computers can only follow instructions literally, but the meaning may not be what the programmer intended (bug).
